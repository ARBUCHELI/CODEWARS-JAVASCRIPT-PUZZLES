# CODEWARS-JAVASCRIPT-PUZZLES 

## Coding Puzzles in Javascript from www.codewars.com

## Kata 1 - Multiply:
Fix the code bug in the code.

## Kata 2 - Multiples of 3 or 5:
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. Also, if a number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

## Kata 3 - Primitives and operator precedence:
Write a function greaterThanLessThan that takes three arguments, a, b, and c, and returns a boolean (true or false), such that:
greaterThanLessThan(1, 2 3) === true
and
greaterThanLessThan(3, 2 1) === true
But also
graterThanLessThan(-3, -2, -1) == false

## Kata 4 - Training JS # 1 - Create your first JS function and print:
Task
Please refer to two example above and write your first JS function.

mission 1:

use keyword function to define your function, function name should be helloWorld(don't forget the () and {})

mission 2:

use keyword var to define a variable str, value of str should be a string: "Hello World!"(don't forget the =).

mission 3:

type the console.log() in the next line(don't forget to put the str in the brackets).

When you have finished the work, click "Run Tests" to see if your code is working properly.
